## JogIt Run Viewer Beta Built with Backbone.js and Twitter Bootstrap ##

Web app to view runs with JogIt built with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) and [Twitter Bootstrap] (http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/).

Still no way to view runs from local device. 


The application runs out-of-the-box with an in-memory data store. If you want to experiment the application with other persistence layers, download the REST services in the following repositories:

- [directory-rest-nodejs](https://github.com/ccoenraets/directory-rest-nodejs) (Node.js/MongoDB implementation)
- [directory-rest-php](https://github.com/ccoenraets/directory-rest-php) (PHP implementation)
- directory-rest-java (Java implementation coming soon)
